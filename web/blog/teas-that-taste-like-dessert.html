        <div class="article-body">
          <p>Some teas taste so good you'd swear someone snuck dessert into your cup. Buttery, creamy, chocolatey, honey-sweet — all from the leaf itself, no sugar needed.</p>

          <p>If you're trying to cut back on sweets or just want something indulgent without the guilt, these five teas are worth knowing about. They're all naturally sweet and don't need anything added.</p>

          <h2>1. Milk Oolong (Jin Xuan)</h2>

          <p>This is the one that converts people. Milk oolong has a naturally creamy, buttery taste that's hard to believe comes from a tea leaf. It's smooth, slightly sweet, and has this almost vanilla-like finish that lingers.</p>

          <p><strong>Where it's from:</strong> Taiwan, usually from the Alishan or Nantou regions.</p>

          <p><strong>How to brew it:</strong> 195°F water, steep for 3 minutes. You can re-steep it 3-4 times and it just keeps giving.</p>

          <p><strong>What it tastes like:</strong> Imagine warm milk with a hint of butter and vanilla. That's not marketing — that's actually what it tastes like.</p>

          <p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Some cheaper versions are artificially flavored. If it smells like a candle, it's probably not the real thing. Look for "Jin Xuan" on the label and buy from a reputable tea shop.</p>

          <h2>2. Chocolate Pu-erh</h2>

          <p>Pu-erh is an aged, fermented tea from China's Yunnan province. The good stuff has this deep, earthy richness that naturally veers into chocolate territory. Some pu-erhs genuinely taste like dark chocolate mixed with forest floor — in the best way possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Where it's from:</strong> Yunnan, China. Shou (ripe) pu-erh is the type that gets chocolatey.</p>

          <p><strong>How to brew it:</strong> 212°F (full boiling), steep 30 seconds to 1 minute. Short steeps, many rounds. This tea can handle 8-10 steepings easily.</p>

          <p><strong>What it tastes like:</strong> Dark chocolate, damp earth, sometimes a hint of dried fruit. It's rich and heavy — more like a dessert course than an afternoon tea.</p>

          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Rinse the leaves first. Pour boiling water over them, wait 5 seconds, dump it out. Then start your actual steeping. This "wakes up" the leaves and washes off any storage dust.</p>

          <h2>3. Vanilla Rooibos</h2>

          <p>Rooibos (red bush tea) is already naturally sweet on its own. Add real vanilla and you've got something that tastes like crème brûlée in a cup. It's caffeine-free too, which makes it a solid nighttime dessert replacement.</p>

          <p><strong>Where it's from:</strong> South Africa. Only grows in the Cederberg region near Cape Town.</p>

          <p><strong>How to brew it:</strong> 212°F, steep 5-7 minutes. Rooibos is very forgiving — you basically can't over-steep it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it tastes like:</strong> Honey, vanilla, woody sweetness. Some people add a splash of milk and it becomes a full-on dessert drink.</p>

          <p><strong>Good to know:</strong> Make sure you're getting real vanilla pieces in the blend, not just "vanilla flavoring." The difference in taste is noticeable.</p>

          <h2>4. Honeybush</h2>

          <p>Honeybush is rooibos's lesser-known cousin, and honestly it might be even better for dessert cravings. The name isn't a gimmick — it legitimately tastes like honey. It's sweet, floral, and almost apricot-like.</p>

          <p><strong>Where it's from:</strong> South Africa, Eastern Cape region.</p>

          <p><strong>How to brew it:</strong> 212°F, steep 5-7 minutes. Same deal as rooibos — very hard to mess up.</p>

          <p><strong>What it tastes like:</strong> Honey, dried apricot, a little bit of caramel. Naturally sweet enough that most people don't add anything to it.</p>

          <p><strong>Why you haven't heard of it:</strong> Honeybush production is tiny compared to rooibos. It's harder to find but most specialty tea shops carry it. This is exactly the kind of tea you'd miss if you only shop at the grocery store.</p>

          <h2>5. Roasted Hojicha</h2>

          <p>Hojicha is Japanese green tea that's been roasted, which turns it brown and completely changes its flavor profile. Instead of grassy and vegetal, you get toasty, nutty, and caramel-sweet. It's what happens when someone takes green tea and makes it actually taste like dessert.</p>

          <p><strong>Where it's from:</strong> Japan. Originally from Kyoto.</p>

          <p><strong>How to brew it:</strong> 175°F, steep 30 seconds to 1 minute. Lower caffeine than most green teas because the roasting process reduces it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it tastes like:</strong> Toasted marshmallow, roasted nuts, caramel. Some people describe it as "campfire in a cup" which is weirdly accurate.</p>

          <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Hojicha lattes are incredible. Brew it strong, add steamed milk. It's like a dessert-coffee hybrid that's actually good for you.</p>

          <h2>The common thread</h2>

          <p>None of these teas need sugar, honey, or anything added. They're naturally sweet or rich enough to satisfy a dessert craving on their own. That's the whole point — you're not masking tea flavor with sweetener, you're finding teas that are inherently indulgent.</p>

          <p>If you want to explore these, most independent tea shops carry at least a few of them. The bigger shops like Harney & Sons, Numi, and Tea Forte all have versions too.</p>
