# Resteeped Content Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

**We are:** A knowledgeable friend who happens to love tea. Warm, confident, helpful.

**We are not:** A tea snob, a salesperson, or a wellness guru.

**Think:** The friend who says "oh, you'd love this one" and is always right.

## Target Audience

- Curious drinkers exploring beyond grocery store teas
- Ages 25-45, mobile-first
- Appreciates quality but isn't an expert
- Wants to discover, not be lectured

## Writing Rules

### Do
- Use plain language over tea jargon
- Focus on taste experience (what does it actually taste like?)
- Add context for when/how to enjoy it
- Keep descriptions mobile-friendly (2-4 sentences max)
- Be specific about flavors (not "delicious," but "honey-sweet with stone fruit")
- Compare to things people know ("brighter than lemon," "like coffee but smoother")

### Don't
- Use em dashes (—)
- Use jargon without explanation (muscatel, first flush, gongfu)
- Use superlatives or marketing fluff ("exquisite," "wonderfully," "artisanal")
- Assume expertise (explain why something matters)
- Be preachy about health benefits
- Write more than 4 sentences

## Formatting

- No em dashes. Use periods or restructure.
- Short sentences are fine.
- Sentence fragments are fine for punch.
- No exclamation marks.

## Jargon Translation Guide

Instead of saying... → Say this:

| Jargon | Plain English |
|--------|---------------|
| First flush | Early spring harvest (lighter, more delicate) |
| Second flush | Summer harvest (fuller, more developed flavor) |
| Muscatel | Grape-like sweetness |
| Oxidation | How processed the leaves are (more = darker, bolder) |
| Astringent | That dry, puckery feeling |
| Brisk | A lively bite, slight sharpness |
| Malty | Toasted, biscuity, like cereal |
| Vegetal | Green, grassy, like fresh vegetables |
| CTC | Small pellet-shaped leaves (brews fast and strong) |
| Orthodox | Whole leaf, traditional style |
| Gongfu | Chinese style brewing with lots of short steeps |

## Examples

### ❌ Before (typical tea marketing)
> A wonderfully mellow golden summer black tea made from pure China bushes at the world-famous Castleton Tea Estate, replete with characteristic fruity notes and soft floral hues.

### ✅ After (Resteeped style)
> From one of India's most famous tea estates. Light gold in the cup with soft fruit and floral notes. If you've found Darjeeling too bitter before, this one's gentler.

---

### ❌ Before
> This tea is exceptionally smooth and sweet, loaded with clarity of flavor, and has an amazing aftertaste.

### ✅ After
> Smooth and sweet with a clean finish that lingers. The kind of tea that makes you pause mid-sip.

---

### ❌ Before
> Enjoy the enlivening, clean energy of authentic stone-milled Japanese Matcha blended with pure cane sugar.

### ✅ After
> Stone-ground Japanese matcha with cane sugar already mixed in. Just add water and whisk. Smooth energy without the coffee crash.

## Tea Type Guidance

### Black Tea
Focus on: Body (light/medium/full), sweetness level, what meals or times it suits

### Green Tea
Focus on: Freshness, grassy vs. sweet, whether it's forgiving to brew

### Oolong
Focus on: Where it falls on the spectrum (closer to green or black?), aroma

### Herbal
Focus on: Primary ingredient, caffeine-free status, when to drink it

### Pu-erh
Focus on: Earthy vs. smooth, whether it's aged, good for pu-erh beginners?

### White Tea
Focus on: Delicacy, subtle sweetness, why it's worth the price

### Matcha
Focus on: Grade (ceremonial vs. culinary), how to prepare, energy level
