# Resteeped Marketing Plan

**Budget:** $50  
**Goal:** Drive initial downloads and build awareness post-App Store approval  
**Prepared by:** TARS  
**Date:** February 12, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Resteeped enters a market where tea enthusiasts have been asking for "Vivino for tea" for nearly a decade. Steepster (the closest competitor) is desktop-only and declining. This is a significant opportunity to capture a passionate, underserved niche.

With a $50 budget, paid advertising (Apple Search Ads requires $50/day minimum) is not viable. The strategy focuses on organic community building, ASO optimization, and targeted micro-influencer outreach.

## Platform Strategy

### Recommended: Instagram + TikTok

| Platform | Verdict | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Instagram** | ✅ Primary | Already have @resteeped. Visual platform perfect for tea aesthetic. Reels can reach new audiences. |
| **TikTok** | ✅ Secondary | Short-form video ideal for brew demos. Younger tea audience. Worth creating. |
| **Threads** | ⚠️ Optional | Low effort since it links to Instagram. Can cross-post. Not a priority. |
| **Twitter/X** | ❌ Skip | Text-heavy, declining engagement, tea community not very active there. |
| **Bluesky** | ❌ Skip | Too small, tech-focused audience, not tea enthusiasts. |

**Recommendation:** Focus on Instagram (already exists) and create TikTok. Threads optional low-effort add-on. Skip Twitter/X and Bluesky entirely.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Before Approval)

### 1.1 App Store Optimization (ASO)

| Element | Current | Optimized |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| App Name | Resteeped | Resteeped: Tea Discovery & Journal |
| Subtitle | (unknown) | Track, Rate & Discover New Teas |
| Keywords | (need to set) | See keyword list below |

**Recommended Keywords (100 chars max for iOS):**
```
tea,teas,brewing,steep,timer,journal,tasting,notes,collection,catalog,tracker,oolong,matcha,herbal
```

**Screenshots Strategy:**
1. Hero shot - "Your personal tea companion" with discovery feed
2. Tea detail page showing FlavorRadar
3. Brew timer in action
4. Collection/favorites view
5. Tasting notes feature
6. Activity feed / community aspect

### 1.2 Social Media Prep

**Instagram (@resteeped):** Already exists - will audit and prep content  
**TikTok (@resteeped):** Need to create

---

## Phase 2: Launch Day

### 2.1 Product Hunt Launch

**Optimal timing:** Saturday or Sunday, 12:01 AM PT (less competition)

**What I need from you:**
- Product Hunt account (or permission to create)
- Brief "maker story" (2-3 sentences)

### 2.2 Reddit Strategy

| Subreddit | Members | Approach |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/tea | 500K+ | Genuine participation, then soft announcement |
| r/TeaPorn | 100K+ | Beautiful tea photos |
| r/Matcha | 50K+ | Matcha-specific features |
| r/puer | 30K+ | Pu-erh enthusiast content |

**Important:** r/tea has strict self-promotion rules. Will participate genuinely first.

### 2.3 Tea Blogger Outreach

**Publications to pitch:**
- World of Tea
- Tea Journey Magazine
- The Daily Tea
- T Ching

---

## Phase 3: Paid Strategy ($50 Budget)

### Recommendation: Micro-Influencer

**Target:** 1-2 tea nano-influencers (1K-10K followers)  
**Budget:** $25-50 per post  
**Platform:** Instagram or TikTok

Title: I built the tea tracking app I've been wanting for years - Resteeped is now on iOS

Hey r/tea,

Like many of you, I've been using Steepster for years and wishing it had a proper mobile app. I finally decided to build what I wanted.

Resteeped is a tea discovery and journaling app with:
- 8,000+ teas from 70+ brands (Harney, Adagio, Yunnan Sourcing, etc.)
- Brew timer with recommended temps/times
- Tasting notes and ratings
- Flavor profiles for discovery

It's free with optional premium features. No ads.

Would genuinely love feedback from this community - you're the people I built this for.

Thanks for checking it out! The database is definitely a work in progress - we're adding new teas regularly. If there's a specific brand you'd like to see, let me know and I'll prioritize it.

**Maker Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Resteeped because I was frustrated. I use Vivino for wine and Untappd for beer, but nothing existed for tea. Steepster is great but desktop-only and hasn't been updated in years.

So I built what I wanted:
- A massive tea database so I don't have to manually add everything
- A timer that actually knows how long to steep my oolong vs my green tea
- Tasting notes I can reference when reordering

The community has been asking for this for almost a decade (seriously, search r/tea for "Vivino for tea"). Happy to finally deliver it.

Would love your feedback!

## Competitive Landscape

| App | Weakness | Resteeped Advantage |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| MyTeaPal | Complex UI, no discovery | Simple, discovery-first |
| Tea Brew Timer | Timer-only, limited catalog | Full database + features |
| Teafinity | Generic, new | Established catalog, community |
| Steepster | Desktop-only, dying | Native mobile, modern UX |

---

## Notes

The tea community is passionate but skeptical of self-promotion. Authentic engagement is critical. The pitch isn't "download our app" - it's "we built the thing you've been asking for."

Market timing is excellent: Steepster declining, no strong mobile competitors, clear demand signal from years of Reddit posts.
