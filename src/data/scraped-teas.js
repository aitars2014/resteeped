    "description": "A gorgeous sun-dried black tea (shaihong) from older arbor trees in Naka Village. Berry and fruit forward, smooth, vibrant, and expressive. This is an extremely solid and captivating tea, perfect for enjoying now but with great potential for aging if properly stored. Sun-dried black teas are their own category, generally from Yunnan but also made with great success in neighboring countries like Vietnam and Laos. Sun-drying preserves the microbial activity in the leaves and keeps the tea alive and developing in the same way that sheng puerh evolves with time and proper storage. Naka Village is located in Mengsong township (Menghai County) in Xishuangbanna. The area is well-known for puerh production, with old trees growing in a cool, misty, high-elevation environment. 2024 spring harvest",

You may have seen Buddha's hand in the grocery store (they do indeed look a bit like hands, though I doubt very much that the Buddha's hands looked like that). This unusual citrus has finger-like segments and an aromatic profile similar to bergamot. In Chinese it's called Fo Shou Gan, a name also used to describe bergamot flavoring.The tea is double scented with Buddha's hand citron pieces and a light touch of bergamot. The citrus element is subtle and not heavy-handed at all, letting the tea's natural fruit character take center stage. The base tea comes from Sanxia District in New Taipei City, northern Taiwan. Sanxia is best known for its green teas but also produces distinctive black teas made from the Qing Xin Gan Zi cultivar. This is the same cultivar used for many high-mountain oolongs, which is why this black tea tastes lighter and more delicate than the malty, rob",

    "description": "This early spring harvest from the Nilgiri Hills in southern India steeps to an amber liquor with a lively, expressive character. There's a mild wintergreen note that comes through clearly, along with herbal orange and green apple notes that add refreshing fruity acidity. The finish is really sweet with touches of caramel, honey, and cream. A hint of floral character emerges as well. The body is lighter and more delicate than typical Indian black teas, with a bright, sparkling quality that's vaguely reminiscent of Taiwan's Ruby 18 but more restrained. It's refreshing and engaging without being heavy. The wet leaves carry a nice aroma: a bit of wintergreen, sweet, and intriguing. Nilgiri teas have earned recognition among tea explorers for their distinctive character. The region's high elevations, two monsoon seasons, and skilled production create teas that are naturally sweet, fruity, and floral with lower tannins than other Indian blacks.

There are ways of making tea that accentuate particular aromatics and this tea is produced with a straightforward approach, not using any of the techniques that have been quite popular over the last ten to fifteen years or so to make newer versions of the oldest and most venerable black tea. It's a very solid tea, without being assertive or burly. It's got an incredible smoothness, indicating that it is a very well made tea.

    "description": "This Tong Mu Guan cake is a highly recommended medium aged white tea from one of our favorite tea partners, Cindy Chen. We've been sourcing Chen's teas for some time now, and her Tong Mu teas always knock it out of the park. It's rare to find white teas from Tong Mu - she's one of about five producers making white tea from this famous region (as of the time of this writing). This tea special - sweet and immediately thick and billowy in the mouth. We got notes of apricot jam, light floral powder, and yellow flowers with later steepings bringing in sweet rain on rocks. The liquor is a lovely pale yellow. You can tell this tea is a knock out from the first sip. Each whole cake is approximately 250 grams. Sun withered. From Spring 2020 harvest.",

Bai Mu Dan white tea, also called White Peony, is similar to Silver Needle in many ways, but whereas Silver Needle is always only the baby fur covered buds, Bai Mud Dan will have baby buds and tender young leaves. The addition of the leaves gives the liquor more body and a bit more of a fruity, rich quality. Tea maker: Chen Qingwen2025 spring harvest",
