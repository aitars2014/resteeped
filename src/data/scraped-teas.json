Sun-dried black teas are their own category, generally from Yunnan but also made with great success in neighboring countries like Vietnam and Laos. Sun-drying preserves the microbial activity in the leaves and keeps the tea alive and developing in the same way that sheng puerh evolves with time and proper storage. Naka Village is located in Mengsong township (Menghai County) in Xishuangbanna. The area is well-known for puerh production, with old trees growing in a cool, misty, high-elevation environment. 2024 spring harvest",

    "description": "This 2001 Raw Liu Bao from Yee On is thick, rich, and warming with an intriguing light herbal and camphor quality. Yee On is famous for their Hong Kong storage, which is very well integrated in this aged tea. The earthy component stays relatively light, the finish is persistently sweet. This tea is super comforting and easy to drink. Liu Bao is related in many respects to ripe puerh tea, but it uses medium-leaf material from Guangxi, not Yunnan large-leaf material. Liu Bao is known to have a betel nut character (hard to say what that is if you haven't happened to have had betel nut!) and an herbal sweetness. Liu Bao's processing methods actually inspired ripe puerh's development in the 1970s. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liu Bao is valued for dispelling dampness and regulating digestion. It's considered both warming and cooling depending on what your body needs.",

    "description": "This 7581 recipe from the Kunming Tea Factory offers a tasty glimpse into the past, a time when shou puerh was often fermented for a shorter period of time than is commonly done now. This lighter touch makes the tea more lively, reminiscent of a well-aged raw puerh.The liquor is a gorgeous deep red (rather than dark brown or black) with lots of clarity and has warming tasting notes of cacao, spice, and wood. It's exceptionally smooth and vibrant. While this recipe is still being made in the modern era, this recipe changed after 1999 so this selection is among the last of the original technique. Each brick is approximately 250 grams.",
