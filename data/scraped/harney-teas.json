    "description": "This tea consists solely of pure golden tips, resulting in a lighter and sweeter flavor compared to most Assams. It is lightly rolled to preserve the tips. With this technique, there is limited oxidation, making the tea less brisk. Natural sweetness in this tea comes from the tips (or the buds) because the plants send extra sugars there to make more leaves. Mokalbari Tea Estate has exclusively provided our 2026 supply of Assam Golden Tips at our request.",

It turns out that we were the first western tea buyers to visit this hidden valley, about four hours south of Changsha. As we rounded our way up the river valley, the air got fresher, and we got more excited. We stopped at the factory owned by Mrs. Xiao. She has run it for the last 13 years and built a beautiful garden that makes great tea. Green Gulou comes from tea plants carefully tended in the steep hills above the factory. We were impressed with the body and sweetness of this tea. These traits come from the umami found in the young tea leaves. The tea is fixed green, rolled, and dried in ovens to preserve its sweetness.",

Just south of the mountains of the Baishanzu Nature Reserve sits the town of Zhenghe. The Golden Monkey made here brews dark and sweet with aromas reminiscent of molasses. Across the mountains from Zhenghe is the town of Songxi. Songxi has big leaves and brews that are lighter and sweeter. Fuan has larger, dark golden leaves. \nPlease note: This product contains four individually packaged tins (Wuyisan, Zhenge, Songxi, and Fuan) containing 2 ounces each and arrives in a black and gold Harney &amp; Sons gift box.",

This area of central Japan is known to have the best shade-grown Gyokuro. The plants gradually receive cover towards the end of the growing season. This stress forces the plant to react by adding more green-appearing chlorophyll. The combination of mouth-filling umami and a very distinctive spinach-like aroma is what makes this tea heavenly.\nUji, located 30 minutes south of Kyoto, is the primary location for growing Gyokuro. To meet the demands of the Emperor and other members of the aristocracy, there were large tea fields and many tea factories built around Kyoto. The twilight of the Edo era saw the commercialization of shade-grown teas.",

Kohei, our host, shared with us the current production of this lighter steamed Sencha, and immediately we were hooked. An early season Sencha coming from eastern Kyushu, the sweet tropical fruit aromas dance delicately above a mellow-bodied cup. The brew is well-balanced umami, with a faint trace of astringency to give it confidence.",

    "description": "This tea comes from the Wazuka Valley in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, and is made by Mr. Wataru. He is a promising young farmer in Wazuka, located on the opposite ridge from where Matsuda, another of our favorite Japanese tea growers, produces tea. Wataru-san is a college graduate that applies novel approaches to making tea, blending Japanese tradition with modern methods. This Guricha is made from the short-period shaded Saemidori cultivar, which has a strong umami. To preserve this feature, he’s opted to omit the last step in traditional sencha making, rolling, which can increase the body of the tea but reduce its umami. The recommendation from Mr. Wataru is to enjoy two steepings. The first is refreshing with vegetal notes, whereas the second will become much more bold.\nGuricha (steamed curly tea) is a kind of Japanese green tea found mainly in Kyushu, the southern island of Japan. Guricha follows a lot of the same processing that Sencha does, except for the last rolling, which is how most Senchas acquire their needle-like shape. This last rolling’s purpose is to damage the structure of the tea leaf, so without this process, Guricha has a lighter taste to it than standard Senchas.",

This variety is one we have sourced over the years, and it is a lightly roasted oolong with pleasant lemon and vegetal flavors. Tea makers have cultivated Dong Ding around the town of Luku in the foothills of Taiwan's central mountain range since the mid-1800s. They adopted the production methods of their cousins in southern Fujian Province, China and roll the large tea leaves into a ball. We visited Mr. Shen in 2024 and enjoyed it very much, so we decided to bring it back again!",

To honor their discovery, this naturally flavored black tea tastes sweet but has no sweetener. 50% of the proceeds will go to T1International.T1International believes in a world where everyone with type 1 diabetes, no matter where they live, has everything they need to survive and achieve their dreams. Approximations say that more than 40 million people around the world live with type 1 diabetes. A large proportion of people with diabetes live in places with inadequate or unaffordable healthcare, which means there are likely hundreds of thousands of people facing death due to a lack of insulin. We support local communities by giving them the tools they need to stand up for their rights so that access to insulin and diabetes supplies becomes a reality for all.\nEach tin contains 20 tea sachets.Each sachet brews one 12 oz. cup of tea.Be sure to recycle your tin, or click here to explore ways to reuse your tins! \nFor more information please visit www.t1international.com",

A dilapidated house dating from the mid-1600s and its outbuildings were included for free. The apple orchard on the property was extraordinary and delighted Mr. Alcott, who considered apples the most perfect food. Not surprisingly, he named this home \"Orchard House.\"\nAfter moving nearly two dozen times in three decades, the Alcotts finally found their anchoring place and, after extensive repairs, resided there for 20 years. Orchard House is most noted for being where Louisa May Alcott wrote and set the beloved novel Little Women in 1868 at a desk her father built for her.\nPlease enjoy this decorative, limited edition tea that we prepared for the release of the 2019 rendition of Little Women. \nEach tin contains 20 tea sachets.Each sachet brews one 12 oz. cup of tea.Be sure to recycle your tin, or click here to explore ways to reuse your tins!\nClick here to see all our Flavored Green Teas.",

Little did Elaine realize she was launching the tea revolution when her complaints about the poor quality of restaurant tea were printed in the New York Times back in 1983. In response, the Times printed an editorial entitled \"Tea Snobs and Coffee Bigots.\" John Harney and Elaine soon became friends and spread the word about tea. They were pleasantly surprised and gratified to witness tea's newfound popularity and the American public's ensuing demand for fine tea. After reading all the positive reviews, Elaine wanted us to share this with you:\n\nDear Tea Lovers:\nIt is with delight that I read you are enjoying my Special Blend. I brewed and tasted many different combinations of fine black teas before I chose the right mix of Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon, and Assam. It is with great pleasure that the very fine tea purveyors, Harney &amp; Sons, make it available to discerning tea drinkers. I lift my cup to all of you. Enjoy!\nElaine",

When we learned that this tea was from the same valley, Wazuka, we were very excited. Organic teas are very important to some tea drinkers. However, finding Japanese-produced organic teas can sometimes be challenging. Teamakers often feel that they can't make good tea without adding nitrogen. Nitrogen is present in every amino acid, including those in your body. Amino acids give Sencha their body, or umami, and they also add sweetness to the brew. However, the makers of this tea get by with natural fertilizers. Yes, the tea is a bit weaker than other Senchas, but is still very nice.",

The cooler air contributes to the delightful aroma. The body of this Sencha is lighter than other Senchas due to its lack of deep steaming.

Once enough tips or buds are gathered to produce Chinese Silver Needle, the plants are allowed to continue growing. Then, when two immature leaves have grown, the whole set is harvested: two leaves and a bud (aka tip). The sets are dried in large barns, where the slow process allows a bit of oxidation to occur. This gives Mutan White some fruity and vegetal flavors. Although the leaves look green, this is a white tea because of the production method.",

This is where the commercialization of white tea began.\nIn the hills outside of Fuding, the fields are full of the special tea cultivar called Da Bei or Big White. The name is apt. These tea plants form fat buds, thickly coated with down. The plant stockpiles goodness in the bud, for it is the plant's future. Inside the tiny silver needle are extra sugars, antioxidants, and even extra caffeine. The downy fuzz is made up of trichomes, which help the immature bud to survive this cold, cruel world. After the buds are painstakingly plucked by hand, most teamakers put the buds in a barn and let them slowly dry out.\nThis subtly sweet tea can be appreciated in a cup, or you can drink it like the Chinese and float a spoonful into a clear glass of hot water. Watch the buds slowly sink in the water. It can be very therapeutic.",

By the time the Bancha harvest begins, the smoother-tasting polyphenols in the leaves have been replaced by harsher ones, and the leaves have lost amino acids that create sweetness and body. Bancha yields a grassier, lighter-bodied tea. Bancha, a brew that is light and enriching, is a wonderful choice for a cup of traditional green tea.",

Ali San was one of the first areas in southern Taiwan to produce high mountain teas. Around 30 years ago, Taiwan's tea industry underwent a significant transformation. They shifted from producing traditional teas for export to the West to focusing on producing high-quality oolongs for the thriving local market. Now, we can all enjoy the delightful, lemony, and creamy flavors of this lightly oxidized oolong.",
